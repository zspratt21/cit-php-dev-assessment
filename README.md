## Introduction

## Installation

## Assumptions
- 'running script' Refers to a script that can be executed in a terminal, where the script then proceeds to execute the specified task(with the supplied parameters) without crashing and handling all errors and exceptions in a graceful manner.
- Errors and exceptions when caught, will be printed to the screen and the app will close gracefully or continue(where appropriate) instead of crashing with a stack trace.
- Special characters in the name and surname fields are considered acceptable, since the brief does not explicitly state they are not allowed.
- The --dry_run task checks individual lines within a given csv file on the basis of its fields alone, irrespective of other lines in the file or entries already existing in the users table.
- Emails should be validated on the RFC 5322 standard.
