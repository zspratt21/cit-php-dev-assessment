# Catalyst IT PHP Developer Assessment

## Assumptions
- 'running script' Refers to a script that can be executed in a terminal, where the script then proceeds to execute the specified task(with the supplied parameters) without crashing and handling all errors and exceptions in a graceful manner.
- Errors and exceptions when caught, will be printed to the screen and the app will close gracefully instead of crashing with a stack trace.
- Special characters in the name and surname fields are considered acceptable since the brief does not explicitly state they are not allowed.
